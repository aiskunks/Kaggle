# Kaggle Datasets

A collection of Kaggle Datasets for binary classification, multiclass classification, regression, time-series analysis, etc. for people who want to test algorithms and libraries against a large number of datasets.  

Larger datasets are reduced to less than 50Mb by random sampling.  Sub-directories are named to group the data into analysis type (binary classification, multiclass classification, regression). Further, when avaible, a simple notebook implementing the full simple analysis pipeline will be added to the directory containing a dataset.
