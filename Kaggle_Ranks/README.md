*Kaggle Contributor*

Go to <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/119626'>very first step - how to become a Contributor</a>.  

1. "Add Your Bio" to "SMS verify your account"
These parts can be accomplished by going to the top left of this page (your icon, that is just white blank box if you haven't finished set your icon) Click Your Profile > My Profile > Edit Profile.
Then filling the required boxes would suffice to finish these requirements.

2. "Run 1 script" and "Make 1 competition submission"
There would be several ways to do this. but just as an example, you go to "Competition" like <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic'>Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster</a>. If you click that there are explanations but just click "Join Competition". You can find the required submission in "Evaluation" tab, and the data you use for training and real submission can be found in "Data" tab.

Now, what you should do actually is the train and find the best way to predict based on the requirements of this competition. However, the goal for now, is just become a Contributor which needs you to submit something. Therefore, all you can do is just download "sample_submission.csv" and upload the same. This is evaluated as low score as expected, but you can at least clear one of the requirement you have for becoming a Contributor.

3. "Make 1 comment" and "Cast 1 Upvote"
This is quite easy - you can just give comment/question on the dataset like <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters'>TMNIST Alphabet (94 characters)</a>, and upvote (sthe same. Hope you like this and comment/Upvote!
